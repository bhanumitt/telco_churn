# An End-to-End Data Science Project on Customer Churn with SHAP prediction

The problem statement that we cover in this project is â€” For a telecommunication organisation, how to identify which customers are gonna churn and what are the possible steps we can take to retain them?

Customer Churn is a loss of customers that the businesses face over a period of time. It is a relevant industry problem and knowing the root causes of the problem can sometimes lead to understanding the inefficiencies of the business and therefore, promoting better customer experience and driving growth in revenue.
